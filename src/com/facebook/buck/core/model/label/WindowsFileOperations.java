  // A note about UNC paths and path prefixes on Windows. The prefixes can be:
  // - "\\?\", meaning it's a UNC path that is passed to user mode unicode WinAPI functions
  //   (e.g. CreateFileW) or a return value of theirs (e.g. GetLongPathNameW); this is the
  //   prefix we'll most often see
  // - "\??\", meaning it's Device Object path; it's mostly only used by kernel/driver functions
  //   but we may come across it when resolving junction targets, as the target's path is
  //   specified with this prefix, see usages of DeviceIoControl with FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT
  // - "\\.\", meaning it's a Device Object path again; both "\??\" and "\\.\" are shorthands
  //   for the "\DosDevices\" Object Directory, so "\\.\C:" and "\??\C:" and "\DosDevices\C:"
  //   and "C:\" all mean the same thing, but functions like CreateFileW don't understand the
  //   fully qualified device path, only the shorthand versions; the difference between "\\.\"
  //   is "\??\" is not entirely clear (one is not available while Windows is booting, but
  //   that only concerns device drivers) but we most likely won't come across them anyway
  // Some of this is documented here:
